# C-software-using-DS-Algorithms
The project will basically represent a code/software using which we can store the details of the qurantined persons staying at any quarantine centre during COVID-19 pandemic.
As some nationwide lockdown norms have been relieved and migrants/ labourers stranded at remote localities are heading back towards their home, demands for quarantine centres have gone up manifold. To deal with this large influx, district administration  has decided to make quarantine centre at the hostelâ€™s of NIT-Silchar.
Quarantine facility at NIT-Silchar can accommodate a maximum of 500 people.
As per district administration, only the flight bound male passengers without accompanying children arriving at Silchar airport will likely to be quarantined for 14 days.
Each quarantined person will be allotted a single room for his stay for the said period.
All the rooms are single rooms numbered from 89 to 411.
Once the quarantined period is over, quarantined person(s) are discharged from the quarantined centre after vacating his room. 
Subject to the availability of rooms in the quarantine centre, district administration allows a limited number of passengers to the said facility.
The nodal officer who administers the quarantine centre has requested the Department of CSE with a request to help him by providing him with a piece of code/software so that the records of the quarantined persons can be stored properly and efficiently.
So basically in this project we have prepared a code using C++ language, which can store the details of the quarantined persons staying at the centre.

WITH THE HELP OF THIS SOFTWARE, WE CAN LOOK WHICH ROOMS HAS BEEN ALLOCATED AND THE ROOMS THAT ARE EMPTY. WE CAN ALSO SEARCH FOR ANY PATIENTS DETAILS BY JUST TYPING HIS/HER NAME. WE ARE ALSO ABLE TO SORT THE NAME OF THE PATIENTS ACCORDING TO THE ROOM NUMBER ALLOCATED.
